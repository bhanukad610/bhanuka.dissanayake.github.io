## Projects
### Praisal - Resource Management Portal

The project aims to transform resource management for Calcey and beyond through the development of a comprehensive tool tailored to the resource management team's requirements. This platform, designed for seamless allocation of human resources based on project needs, addresses the limitations of the current spreadsheet-based system. Featuring a user-friendly interface and robust functionality, it empowers project managers, directors, HR personnel, and IT administrators to efficiently manage resource requests, fulfillments, and configurations. By streamlining processes and mitigating risks such as data corruption and performance issues, the platform aims to enhance productivity and decision-making capabilities while facilitating smart analytics-driven insights. Ultimately, the goal is to deliver a scalable solution benefiting Calcey internally and offering potential as a customizable product for external organizations seeking optimized resource allocation workflows.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
